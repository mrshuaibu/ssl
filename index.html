                <h1>What is SSL</h1>
                <p>
                    SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a technology that encrypts the 
                    data exchanged between a user's browser and a website, 
                    ensuring that sensitive information like passwords and 
                    credit card details remain private. It’s what keeps 
                    communication secure when you visit websites. You might have 
                    noticed a small padlock icon in the browser’s address 
                    bar—this indicates that SSL is active.
                </p>
                <h2>What is TLS?</h2>
                <p>
                    TLS (Transport Layer Security) is the updated and more secure 
                    version of SSL. Though we often refer to “SSL” in general 
                    terms, most modern websites use TLS. Both SSL and TLS aim to 
                    protect data, but TLS offers better security and performance.
                </p>
                <h3>How can I tell that my webpage is secure?</h3>
                <p>
                    A webpage is secure if it shows the padlock icon in the 
                    browser’s address bar. You’ll also notice that the web 
                    address starts with "https" (instead of "http"). This means 
                    the website is using SSL or TLS to encrypt the data you send 
                    and receive.
                </p>
                <h3>What does it mean to be secure?</h3>
                <p>
                    When a webpage is secure, it means that the information you 
                    share (like login credentials or personal data) is encrypted,
                    preventing hackers from easily intercepting or tampering with 
                    it.
                </p>
                <h3>What is encryption and why do I care?</h3>
                <p>
                    Encryption is the process of scrambling data so that only 
                    authorized parties can understand it. It’s like sending a 
                    coded message that can only be decoded by the right person. 
                    Without encryption, your private information could be 
                    intercepted and misused by attackers. So, encryption ensures 
                    privacy and security.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Do the prefixes HTTP or HTTPS matter when we're talking about 
                    secure websites?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, they matter! "HTTP" stands for HyperText Transfer 
                    Protocol and is used for transmitting data over the web, 
                    but it’s not secure. "HTTPS" adds an "S," which stands for 
                    "Secure." The "S" indicates that the website is using SSL/TLS 
                    encryption to protect the data being transferred.
                </p>
                <h3>What is an SSL certificate authority?</h3>
                <p>
                    An SSL certificate authority (CA) is a trusted organization 
                    that issues SSL certificates to websites. These certificates 
                    verify that the website is legitimate and trustworthy, 
                    ensuring that users are connecting to the correct and secure 
                    server.
